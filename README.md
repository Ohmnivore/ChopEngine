# Building
* dependencies: flow, snow, mint, snow binaries (http://build.luxeengine.com/snow/), Haxe 3.2.1, hxcpp 3.2.193, (all of these were last updated on December 1 2015)
* you have to change your flow config to **files_output_list: true**, ChopEngine relies on that for its preloader
* then build as usual with flow: **flow run [platform]**
* the prime targets are windows, linux, and mac
* nothing keeps it from running on mobile and web, but I want to concentrate on the desktop targets first
