Some of my code originates from a magic tree that grows over 9000 lines of code per second.
Another part of my code is inspired by tutorials and other peoples' code.
I also use libraries (sparingly) because I want to stay sane.
I hope to give appropriate credit to all the authors whose work I'm using.
